### Hi there, this is [Lixu Jin (金理旭)](https://jinlx.github.io/) 👋

- 🔭 I am a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University in Prof. [Xiaomeng Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RoWh6MEAAAAJ&hl=en)’s group, where I integrate satellite remote sensing (e.g., TROPOMI, TEMPO, VIIRS) with atmospheric chemistry modeling to quantify wildfire smoke emissions–chemistry–exposure and their impacts on air quality and health.
- 🎓 I earned my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Chemistry from the University of Montana**, where I worked with Prof. [Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en) on observation-constrained modeling of wildfire VOC chemistry.
- 🌱 My current interests include:
  - Wildfire smoke (emissions, chemistry, and exposure)
  - Air quality & public health
  - VOC emissions and chemistry; ozone photochemistry
  - Chemical mechanism development
  - Machine learning and data-driven analysis
